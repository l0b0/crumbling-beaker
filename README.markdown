Crumpling beaker
================

Animation of a crumpling beaker.

Scene
-----

A female person sitting by a simple table in a living room lit by moonlight. She is deathly pale and focused. The table holds a single, pristine, blood-filled wooden beaker and some candle lights. She lifts the cup with both hands, drinks the blood and puts the unchanged cup back on the table in a focused manner, closes her eyes and waits. After a short time, simultaneously her face rejuvenates while the wood of the beaker crumples/withers: The colour turns gray, cracks appear, and the overall size shrinks somewhat.
